<p style="font-size:30px"> Welcome to Sihao Liu (Daniel) 's GitHub page.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px"> I am currently a postgraduate student at  <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a> (UCL). </p>
<p style="font-size:30px"> Staring this September I will be a pre-doctoral research assistant working on theoretical (or computational) neuroscience, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/people/caswell-barry">Caswell Barry</a>, supported by <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/research-and-funding-calls/ai-fellowships">Turing AI Fellowship</a>. I work closely with people in UCL <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/cell-and-developmental-biology">Cell and Developmental Biology</a>, <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/ucl-centre-artificial-intelligence">Centre for Artificial Intelligence</a>, the <a href="https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/">Sainsbury Wellcome Centre</a> and the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit">Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit</a>.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px"> Theoretical neuroscience studies the nervous system emplying methods and theories from neurobiology, mathematics,, machine learning, information theory and signal processing, statistical physics, and many more. Below is a brief summary of my interests: </p>
<ul style="font-size:30px">
  <li>Probabilistic (or Bayesian) computations in the brain: receptive field models, population codes, neural representation of uncertainty, predictive coding, etc..</li>
  <li>The associated approximate Bayesian inference schemes, mostly recognition models, inspired by or inspiring the above mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Spatial learning, navigation and relational memory: how place cells, grid cells, etc. work together for much of the EC/HPC functions.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:30px"> In the past, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/natural-sciences/">Natural Sciences</a> (major in Neuroscience, minor in Mathematics and Statistics) at UCL, and subsequently remained a UCL alumni scholar for the Master of Science in <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/study">Machine Learning</a>, to be completed in September. </p>
